## About The Project

The official discord client is not that bad and it's possible for improvement. Modifications like [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) or [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) are really nice projects that definitely improve the overall experience using the official client.

But here's why I am building a custom discord client:

- Completely made from scratch, improving overall performance
- Overall everything is customizable and has no risk of breaking after an update
- Direct plugin support (not implemented _yet_)
- Just for fun. This entire project is just a hobby.

Of course, not everything will implemented exactly or in some way just like the official client, but that's the goal. Feature requests are always welcome, because I want to improve the client for everyone.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
